Delete the elements in an linked list whose sum is equal to zero
ANS: To delete the elements whose sum is equal to zero, we can use a hash table to keep track of the prefix sum of the linked list. We traverse the linked list and keep track of the current sum. If the current sum is not in the hash table, we add it to the hash table. Otherwise, we remove the nodes between the two occurrences of the same sum.
Here is the Python code to achieve this: 
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

def deleteZeroSumSublists(head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
    dummy = ListNode(0)
    dummy.next = head
    curr_sum = 0
    d = {0: dummy}
    
    while head:
        curr_sum += head.val
        if curr_sum in d:
            prev = d[curr_sum]
            remove = prev.next
            while remove != head:
                curr_sum += remove.val
                del d[curr_sum]
                remove = remove.next
            prev.next = head.next
        else:
            d[curr_sum] = head
        head = head.next
        
    return dummy.next

Reverse a linked list in groups of given size
To reverse a linked list in groups of a given size, we can traverse the linked list, reversing each group of nodes as we encounter them. We keep track of the head and tail of the current group so that we can connect them to the next group.
Here is the Python code to achieve this:
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

def reverseKGroup(head: ListNode, k: int) -> ListNode:
    dummy = ListNode(0)
    dummy.next = head
    prev = dummy
    
    while True:
        curr = prev.next
        tail = prev
        for i in range(k):
            tail = tail.next
            if not tail:
                return dummy.next
        for i in range(k-1):
            temp = prev.next
            prev.next = curr.next
            curr.next = curr.next.next
            prev.next.next = temp
        prev = curr
    
    return dummy.next

Merge a linked list into another linked list at alternate positions.
To merge a linked list into another linked list at alternate positions, we can traverse both lists simultaneously, inserting the nodes of the second list into the first list at alternate positions. We keep track of the previous node in the first list so that we can insert the nodes correctly.
Here is the Python code to achieve this:
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

def mergeAlternate(head1: ListNode, head2: ListNode) -> ListNode:
    curr1 = head1
    curr2 = head2
    
    while curr1 and curr2:
        temp1 = curr1.next
        temp2 = curr2.next
        curr1.next = curr2
        curr2.next = temp1
        curr1 = temp1
        curr2 = temp2
    
    return head1

In an array, Count Pairs with given sum
To count pairs with a given sum in an array, we can use a hash table to keep track of the occurrence of each number. We traverse the array, for each element, we check if its complement exists in the hash table. If it exists, we add the count of its complement to the total count.
Here is the Python code: 
def countPairsWithSum(arr, k):
    d = {}
    count = 0
    
    for num in arr:
        complement = k - num
        if complement in d:
            count += d[complement]
        if num in d:
            d[num] += 1
        else:
            d[num] = 1
    
    return count

Find duplicates in an array
To find duplicates in an array, we can use a hash table to keep track of the occurrence of each number. We traverse the array, for each element, we check if its occurrence count is greater than 1. If it is, we add it to the list of duplicates.

Here is the Python code to find duplicates in an array:
def findDuplicates(arr):
    d = {}
    duplicates = []
    
    for num in arr:
        if num in d:
            d[num] += 1
        else:
            d[num] = 1
            
    for num in d:
        if d[num] > 1:
            duplicates.append(num)
    
    return duplicates

Find the Kth largest and Kth smallest number in an array
To find the Kth largest and Kth smallest number in an array, we can sort the array in ascending or descending order and then return the Kth smallest or largest number, respectively. Alternatively, we can use a min-heap or a max-heap data structure to efficiently find the Kth smallest or largest number, respectively.

Here is the Python code to find the Kth largest and Kth smallest number in an array using sorting:
def kthSmallest(arr, k):
    arr.sort()
    return arr[k-1]

def kthLargest(arr, k):
    arr.sort(reverse=True)
    return arr[k-1]
Here is the Python code to find the Kth smallest number in an array using a min-heap:
import heapq

def kthSmallest(arr, k):
    heap = arr[:k]
    heapq.heapify(heap)
    
    for num in arr[k:]:
        if num < heap[0]:
            heapq.heappop(heap)
            heapq.heappush(heap, num)
            
    return heap[0]
Here is the Python code to find the Kth largest number in an array using a max-heap:
import heapq

def kthLargest(arr, k):
    heap = [-num for num in arr[:k]]
    heapq.heapify(heap)
    
    for num in arr[k:]:
        if num > -heap[0]:
            heapq.heappop(heap)
            heapq.heappush(heap, -num)
            
    return -heap[0]

Move all the negative elements to one side of the array
To move all the negative elements to one side of the array, we can use the two-pointer technique. We maintain two pointers, left and right, initially pointing to the beginning and end of the array, respectively. We then traverse the array, for each element we check if it is negative. If it is, we swap it with the element at index left and increment left. If it is positive, we swap it with the element at index right and decrement right. We repeat this process until left and right cross each other.

Here is the Python code to move all the negative elements to one side of the array:
def moveNegatives(arr):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    
    while left <= right:
        if arr[left] < 0:
            left += 1
        else:
            arr[left], arr[right] = arr[right], arr[left]
            right -= 1
    
    return arr

Reverse a string using a stack data structure
To reverse a string using a stack data structure, we can push each character of the string onto a stack, and then pop them out of the stack in reverse order to create the reversed string.

Here is the Python code to reverse a string using a stack:
def reverseString(s):
    stack = []
    for c in s:
        stack.append(c)
    
    reversed_s = ''
    while stack:
        reversed_s += stack.pop()
    
    return reversed_s
Here is the modified Python code to reverse a string using a list as a stack:
def reverseString(s):
    stack = list(s)
    
    reversed_s = ''
    while stack:
        reversed_s += stack.pop()
    
    return reversed_s

Evaluate a postfix expression using stack
To evaluate a postfix expression using a stack, we can use the following algorithm:

Create an empty stack to store the operands.
Iterate through each character in the postfix expression.
If the character is an operand (a number), push it onto the stack.
If the character is an operator (+, -, *, /), pop the top two elements from the stack, perform the operation, and push the result back onto the stack.
After iterating through all the characters, the final result will be on top of the stack. Pop it from the stack and return it.
Here is the Python code to evaluate a postfix expression using a stack:
def evaluatePostfix(expr):
    stack = []
    
    for c in expr:
        if c.isdigit():
            stack.append(int(c))
        else:
            op2 = stack.pop()
            op1 = stack.pop()
            if c == '+':
                result = op1 + op2
            elif c == '-':
                result = op1 - op2
            elif c == '*':
                result = op1 * op2
            elif c == '/':
                result = op1 / op2
            stack.append(result)
    
    return stack.pop()

Implement a queue using the stack data structure
We can implement a queue using two stacks. The first stack will be used to enqueue elements, and the second stack will be used to dequeue elements.

Here is the Python code to implement a queue using two stacks:
class Queue:
    def __init__(self):
        self.in_stack = []
        self.out_stack = []
    
    def enqueue(self, val):
        self.in_stack.append(val)
    
    def dequeue(self):
        if not self.out_stack:
            while self.in_stack:
                self.out_stack.append(self.in_stack.pop())
        return self.out_stack.pop()
    
    def is_empty(self):
        return not (self.in_stack or self.out_stack)
